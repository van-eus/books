    <h1>These Lies of Gold</h1>
    
    <p id="p">I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, looking down
        from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t help but think
        about suicide.
        Not my own. I like my life enough to want to see it through.
        I’m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come
        to the decision to just end their own lives. Do they ever regret it? In the
        moment after letting go and the second before they make impact,
        there has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they
        look at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, “Well, crap.
        This was a bad idea.”
        Somehow, I think not.
        I think about death a lot. Particularly today, considering I just—
        twelve hours earlier—gave one of the most epic eulogies the people
        of Plethora, Maine, have ever witnessed. Okay, maybe it wasn’t the
        most epic. It very well could be considered the most disastrous. I guess
        that would depend on whether you were asking my mother or me. My
        mother, who probably won’t speak to me for a solid year after today.
        Don’t get me wrong; the eulogy I delivered wasn’t profound
        enough to make history, like the one Brooke Shields delivered at
        Michael Jackson’s funeral.Or the one delivered by Steve Jobs’s sister.
        Or Pat Tillman’s brother. But it was epic in its own way.
        I was nervous at first. It was the funeral of the prodigious Andrew
        Bloom, after all. Adored mayor of my hometown of Plethora, Maine.
        Owner of the most successful real-estate agency within city limits.
        Husband of the highly adored Jenny Bloom, the most revered
        teaching assistant in all of Plethora. And father of Lily Bloom—that
        strange girl with the erratic red hair who once fell in love with a
        homeless guy and brought great shame upon her entire family.
        That would be me.<br>I’m Lily Bloom, and Andrew was my father.
        As soon as I finished delivering his eulogy today, I caught a flight
        straight back to Boston and hijacked the first roof I could find. Again,
        not because I’m suicidal. I have no plans to scale off this roof. I just
        really needed fresh air and silence, and dammit if I can’t get that
        from my third floor apartment with absolutely no rooftop access and
        a roommate who likes to hear herself sing.
        I didn’t account for how cold it would be up here, though. It’s not
        unbearable, but it’s not comfortable, either. At least I can see the
        stars. Dead fathers and exasperating roommates and questionable
        eulogies don’t feel so awful when the night sky is clear enough to
        literally feel the grandeur of the universe.
        I love it when the sky makes me feel insignificant.
        I like tonight.
        Well . . . let me rephrase this so that it more appropriately reflects
        my feelings in past tense.
        I liked tonight.
        But unfortunately for me, the door was just shoved open so hard, I
        expect the stairwell to spit a human out onto the rooftop. The door
        slams shut again and footsteps move swiftly across the deck. I don’t
        even bother looking up. Whoever it is more than likely won’t even
        notice me back here straddling the ledge to the left of the door. They
        came out here in such a hurry, it isn’t my fault if they assume they’re
        alone.
        I sigh quietly, close my eyes and lean my head against the stucco
        wall behind me, cursing the universe for ripping this peaceful,
        introspective moment out from under me. The least the universe
        could do for me today is ensure that it’s a woman and not a man. If
        I’m going to have company, I’d rather it be a female. I’m tough for
        my size and can probably hold my own in most cases, but I’m too
        comfortable right now to be on a rooftop alone with a strange man in
        the middle of the night. I might fear for my safety and feel the need
        to leave, and I really don’t want to leave. As I said before . . . I’m
        comfortable.
        I finally allow my eyes to make the journey to the silhouette leaning
        over the ledge. As luck would have it, he’s definitely male. Even
        leaning over the rail, I can tell he’s tall. Broad shoulders create a
        strong contrast to the fragile way he’s holding his head in his hands. I
        can barely make out the heavy rise and fall of his back as he drags in
        deep breaths and forces them back out when he’s done with them.
        He appears to be on the verge of a breakdown. I contemplate
        speaking up to let him know he has company, or clearing my throat,
        but between thinking it and actually doing it, he spins around and
        kicks one of the patio chairs behind him.
        I flinch as it screeches across the deck, but being as though he isn’t
        even aware he has an audience, the guy doesn’t stop with just one
        kick. He kicks the chair repeatedly, over and over.<span class="part2">Rather than give
        way beneath the blunt force of his foot, all the chair does is scoot
        farther and farther away from him.
        That chair must be made from marine-grade polymer.
        I once watched my father back over an outdoor patio table made of
        marine-grade polymer, and it practically laughed at him. Dented his
        bumper, but didn’t even put a scratch on the table.
        This guy must realize he’s no match for such a high-quality
        material, because he finally stops kicking the chair. He’s now standing
        over it, his hands clenched in fists at his sides. To be honest, I’m a
        little envious. Here this guy is, taking his aggression out on patio
        furniture like a champ. He’s obviously had a shitty day, as have I, but
        whereas I keep my aggression pent up until it manifests in the form of
        passive-aggressiveness, this guy actually has an outlet.
        My outlet used to be gardening. Any time I was stressed, I’d just go
        out to the backyard and pull every single weed I could find. But since
        the day I moved to Boston two years ago, I haven’t had a backyard. Or
        a patio. I don’t even have weeds.
        Maybe I need to invest in a marine-grade polymer patio chair.
        w, rigid even. Almost as if he’s nervous I’m going to fall.
        I’m not. This ledge is at least a foot wide, and I’m mostly on the roof
        side. I could easily catch myself before I fell, not to mention I’ve got
        the wind in my favor.
        I glance down at my legs and then back up at him. “No, thanks. I’m
        quite comfortable where I am.”
        He turns a little, like he can’t look straight at me. “Please get
        down.” It’s more of a demand now, despite his use of the word please.
        “There are seven empty chairs up here.”
        “Almost six,” I correct, reminding him that he just tried to murder
        one of them. He doesn’t find the humor in my response. When I fail
        to follow his orders, he takes a couple of steps closer.
        “You are a mere three inches from falling to your death. I’ve been
        around enough of that for one day.” He motions for me to get down
        again. “You’re making me nervous. Not to mention ruining my high.”
        I roll my eyes and swing my legs over. “Heaven forbid a joint go to
        waste.” I hop down and wipe my hands across my jeans. “Better?” I say
        as I walk toward him.</span> 
        <span class="part2"> lets out a rush of air, as if seeing me on the ledge actually had
        him holding his breath. I pass him to head for the side of the roof
        with the better view, and as I do, I can’t help but notice how
        unfortunately cute he is.
        No. Cute is an insult.
        “No one knows. It happened late in the evening. His
        wife said she was cooking dinner and he told her he was coming up
        here to take some pictures of the sunset. He was a photographer.
        They think he was leaning over the ledge to get a shot of the skyline,
        and he slipped.”
        I look over the ledge, wondering how someone could possibly put
        themselves in a situation where they could fall by accident. But then I
        remember I was just straddling the ledge on the other side of the roof
        at’s a very accurate description.”
        “I’ve been here two months. I’m not even in purgatory yet, so
        you’re doing better than I am.”
        “What brought you to Boston?”
        “My residency. And my sister lives here.” He taps his foot and says,
        “Right beneath us, actually. Married a tech-savvy Bostonian and they
        bought the entire top floor.”
        I look down. “The entire top floor?”
        He nods. “Lucky bastard works from home. Doesn’t even have to
        change out of his pajamas and makes seven figures a year.”
        Lucky bastard, indeed.
        “What kind of residency? Are you a doctor?”
        He nods. “Neurosurgeon. Less than a year left of my residency and
        then it’s official.”
        Stylish, well spoken, and smart. And smokes pot. If this were an SAT
        question, I would ask which one didn’t belong. “Should doctors be
        smoking weed?”</span>
        <span class="part3">He smirks. “Probably not. But if we didn’t indulge on occasion,
        there would be a lot more of us taking the leap over these ledges, I
        can promise you that.” He’s facing forward again with his chin resting
        on his arms. His eyes are closed now, like he’s enjoying the wind
        against his face. He doesn’t look as intimidating like this.
        “You want to know something that only the locals know?”
        “Of course,” he says, bringing his attention back to me.
        I point to the east. “See that building? The one with the green
        roof?”
        He nods.
        “do is laugh at myself.
        He smiles. “It’s Ryle,” he says. “Ryle Kincaid.”
        I sigh, sinking into myself. “That’s a really great name.”
        “Why do you sound sad about it?”
        “Because, I’d give anything for a great name.”
        “You don’t like the name Lily?”
        I tilt my head and cock an eyebrow. “My last name . . . is Bloom.”
        He’s quiet. I can feel him trying to hold back his pity.
        head. “Worse.”
        “Violet?”
        “I e more curious, like his intrigue is actually authentic. “Were
        you close?”
        That’s a hard question. I rest my chin on my arms and look down at
        the street again. “I don’t know,” I say with a shrug. “As his daughter, I
        loved him. But as a human, I hated him.”
        I can feel him watching me for a moment, and then he says, “I like
        that. Your honesty.”
        He likes my honesty. I think I might be blushing.
        We’re both quiet again for a while, and then he says, “Do you ever
        wish people were more transparent?”
        “How so?”
        He picks at a piece of chipped stucco with his thumb until it breaks
        loose. He flicks it over the ledge. “I feel like everyone fakes who they
        really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up.
        Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.”
        Either his high is setting in, or he’s just very introspective. Either
        way, I’m okay with it. My favorite conversations are the ones with no
        real answers.
        “I don’t think being a little guarded is a negative thing,” I say.
        “Naked truths aren’t always pretty.”
        He stares at me for a moment. “Naked truths,” he repeats. “I like
        that.” He turns around and walks to the middle of the rooftop. He
        adjusts the back on one of the patio loungers behind me and lowers
        himself onto it. It’s the kind you lie on, so he pulls his hands behind
        his head and looks up at the sky. I claim the one next to him and
        adjust it until I’m in the same position as him.
        “Tell me a naked truth, Lily.”
        “Pertaining to what?”
        He shrugs. “I don’t know. Something you aren’t proud of.
        Something that will make me feel a little less screwed up on the
        inside.”
        He’s staring up at the sky, waiting on me to answer. My eyes follow
        the line of his jaw, the curve of his cheeks, the outline of his lips. His
        eyebrows are drawn together in contemplation. I don’t understand
        why, but he seems to need conversation right now. I think about his
        question and try to find an honest answer. When I come up with one,
        I look away from him and back up to the sky.
      “My father was abusive. Not to me—to my mother. He would get so
        angry when they fought that sometimes he would hit her. When that
        happened, he would spend the next week or two making up for it. He
        would do things like buy her flowers or take us out to a nice dinner.
        Sometimes he would buy me stuff because he knew I hated it when
        they fought. When I was a kid, I found myself looking forward to the
        nights they would fight. Because I knew if he hit her, the two weeks
        that followed would be great.” I pause. </span> <span class="part4"> I’m not sure I’ve ever admitted
        that to myself. “Of course if I could, I would have made it to where he
        never touched her. But the abuse was inevitable with their marriage,
        and it became our norm. When I got older, I realized that not doing
        something about it made me just as guilty. I spent most of my life
        hating him for being such a bad person, but I’m not so sure I’m much
        better. Maybe we’re both bad people.”
        Ryle looks over at me with a thoughtful expression. “Lily,” he says
        pointedly. “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people
        who sometimes do bad things.”
        I open my mouth to respond, but his words strike me silent. We’re
        all just people who sometimes do bad things. I guess that’s true in a way. No
        one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just
        forced to work harder at suppressing the bad</span></p>
